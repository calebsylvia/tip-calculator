# Peer Review: This looks good for the most part, I would suggest using the code I put in chat to remove the steppers on the inputs and add onKeyDown={(evt) => ["e", "E", "+", "-"].includes(evt.key) && evt.preventDefault()} to your inputs to stop people from inputting e, it gets a little wonky at the tablet size but on desktop and mobile it looks good. Good Job!
